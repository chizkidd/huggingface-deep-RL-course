The goal is to push the cart left or right **so that the pole stays in the equilibrium.**\n\nThe episode ends if:\n- The pole Angle is greater than ±12°\n- Cart Position is greater than ±2.4\n- Episode length is greater than 500\n\nWe get a reward 💰 of +1 every timestep the Pole stays in the equilibrium.","metadata":{"id":"AH_TaLKFXo_8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"env_id = \"CartPole-v1\"\n# Create the env\nenv = gym.make(env_id)\n\n# Create the evaluation env\neval_env = gym.make(env_id)\n\n# Get the state space and action space\ns_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]\na_size = env.action_space.n","metadata":{"id":"POOOk15_K6KA","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-30T18:09:04.985308Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-30T18:09:04.985778Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-30T18:09:05.020950Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-01-30T18:09:04.985757Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-30T18:09:05.020289Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/gym/core.py:317: DeprecationWarning: \u001b[33mWARN: Initializing wrapper in old step API which returns one bool instead of two.

Can you get to the top?\n\nHere are some ideas to achieve so:\n* Train more steps\n* Try different hyperparameters by looking at what your classmates have done 👉 https://huggingface.co/models?other=reinforce\n* **Push your new trained model** on the Hub 🔥\n* **Improving the implementation for more complex environments** (for instance, what about changing the network to a Convolutional Neural Network to handle\nframes as observation)?","metadata":{"id":"7VDcJ29FcOyb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Congrats on finishing this unit**! There was a lot of information.\nAnd congrats on finishing the tutorial.

This way, you will be ready to participate in the **AI vs AI challenges where you'll train your agents\nto compete against other agents in a snowball fight and a soccer game.**\n\nSounds fun? See you next time!\n\nFinally, we would love **to hear what you think of the course and how we can improve it**.
