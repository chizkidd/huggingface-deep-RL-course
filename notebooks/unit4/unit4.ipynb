The goal is to push the cart left or right **so that the pole stays in the equilibrium.**\n\nThe episode ends if:\n- The pole Angle is greater than ±12°\n- Cart Position is greater than ±2.4\n- Episode length is greater than 500\n\nWe get a reward 💰 of +1 every timestep the Pole stays in the equilibrium.","metadata":{"id":"AH_TaLKFXo_8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"env_id = \"CartPole-v1\"\n# Create the env\nenv = gym.make(env_id)\n\n# Create the evaluation env\neval_env = gym.make(env_id)\n\n# Get the state space and action space\ns_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]\na_size = env.action_space.n","metadata":{"id":"POOOk15_K6KA","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-30T18:09:04.985308Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-30T18:09:04.985778Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-30T18:09:05.020950Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-01-30T18:09:04.985757Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-30T18:09:05.020289Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/gym/core.py:317: DeprecationWarning: \u001b[33mWARN: Initializing wrapper in old step API which returns one bool instead of two.

Some additional challenges 🏆\nThe best way to learn **is to try things on your own**! As you saw, the current agent is not doing great. As a first suggestion, you can train for more steps. But also trying to find better parameters.\n\nIn the [Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard) you will find your agents. Can you get to the top?\n\nHere are some ideas to achieve so:\n* Train more steps\n* Try different hyperparameters by looking at what your classmates have done 👉 https://huggingface.co/models?other=reinforce\n* **Push your new trained model** on the Hub 🔥\n* **Improving the implementation for more complex environments** (for instance, what about changing the network to a Convolutional Neural Network to handle\nframes as observation)?","metadata":{"id":"7VDcJ29FcOyb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Congrats on finishing this unit**! There was a lot of information.\nAnd congrats on finishing the tutorial. You've just coded your first Deep Reinforcement Learning agent from scratch using PyTorch and shared it on the Hub 🥳.\n\nDon't hesitate to iterate on this unit **by improving the implementation for more complex environments** (for instance, what about changing the network to a Convolutional Neural Network to handle\nframes as observation)?\n\nIn the next unit, **we're going to learn more about Unity MLAgents**, by training agents in Unity environments. This way, you will be ready to participate in the **AI vs AI challenges where you'll train your agents\nto compete against other agents in a snowball fight and a soccer game.**\n\nSounds fun? See you next time!\n\nFinally, we would love **to hear what you think of the course and how we can improve it**. If you have some feedback then, please 👉  [fill this form](https://forms.gle/BzKXWzLAGZESGNaE9)\n\nSee you in Unit 5! 🔥\n\n### Keep Learning, stay awesome 🤗\n\n","metadata":{"id":"x62pP0PHdA-y"}}]}
