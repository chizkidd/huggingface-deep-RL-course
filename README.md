# Hugging Face Deep RL Course 

This repository documents my journey through the [Hugging Face Deep Reinforcement Learning Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/). It contains my progress, notes, implementations, notebooks, environment setups, and the agents I've trained to master various tasks.

--- 
## Goals
- Understand the theoretical foundations of Reinforcement Learning.
- Learn to use libraries like **Stable Baselines3**, **Gymnasium**, and **RL Baselines3 Zoo**.
- Train agents to play games (Lunar Lander, Atari) and solve robotics tasks.
- Share my models on the Hugging Face Hub.
